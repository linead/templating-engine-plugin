Plugin Library Provider
-----------------------

JTE makes it possible to package a set of libraries into a Jenkins Plugin.  

When a library-providing plugin has been installed, a new option becomes available when selecting a library source:

After selecting ``From a Library Providing Plugin``, just select the library providing plugin from the autopopulated dropdown list.

Why package libraries this way?
===============================

It's a lot less work to configure a source code repository and configure it as a library source. 
So why would someone want to spend the time packaging their libraries as a Jenkins Plugin? 

**1. Plugin Dependency Management**

    | Steps contributed by libraries often rely on Jenkins plugins in their implementation.  Packing libraries as a 
    | Jenkins Plugin ensures that all other plugin dependencies (and their versions) are satisfied when the library 
    | providing plugin is installed. 

**2. Initialization Performance** 

    | It slows down library loading to reach out to a remote source code repository to retrieve libraries. 
    | When libraries are packaged in a Jenkins Plugin, library loading can be sped up significantly. 

**3. Ensuring a specific version of JTE** 

    | It can be helpful to ensure that specific version of the Templating Engine Plugin is installed if the 
    | interface between JTE and libraries is changed. 

**4. Library Source Versioning** 

    | One specific use-case for the Templating Engine Plugin is for DevOps engineers supporting multiple pipelines 
    | simultaneously.  In these situations, the libraries provided are likely shared across the teams as well. 
    | Over time, libraries can be changed in a way that breaks backwards compatibility.  Packaging libraries as 
    | a plugin allows you to version your set of libraries as an artifact where teams can upgrade when it makes 
    | the most operational sense.
